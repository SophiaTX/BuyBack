The following guide will provide SophiaTX Buyback instructions for anyone using a MyEtherWallet (MEW) or Meta Mask account.

Before conducing the buyback procedure, make sure your Ethereum address is in the SophiaTX's Github [buyback_mappings](buyback_mappings.txt) file, which can be accessed following this [link](https://github.com/SophiaTX/BuyBack).

Once you've confirmed that your address is in the file, you can proceed to the buyback procedure. In case you did not find your Ethereum address and SophiaTX account in this file, don't worry; we have created a third process via which You can also participate in the buyback.

## Buyback via MyEtherWallet

1. Choose **“Send Ether & Token”** category from the top ribbon. Using MEW, holders can choose among multiple methods to access their wallet and send their tokens for buyback. 
2. After successfully accessing their wallet on MEW, paste the buyback address in the **“To Address”**, which can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xBFEd0249222897bEEaA344b07B98f322f6FcD907)
3. In the **“Amount to send”** field, holders can send either their entire ERC-20 token balance or a desired amount. Don’t forget to choose **“SPHTX”** from the dropdown menu to the left of the field.
